# Issues
* will have issue with nButton if using vue@1.0.21 - currently 1.0.16 is stable

# further steps
* integrate docker to build seed front-end env
* new architecture to integrate one page app & multi page app.
* use webpack only for code package, integrate gulp for tasks(webpack config not friendly)
* status control optimize(compare to Vuex)
* es6 version
